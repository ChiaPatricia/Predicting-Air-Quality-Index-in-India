We will use a dataset in Kaggle which deals with air quality in India from 2015 to 2020, across various cities and stations. The variables include PM2.5, PM10, Air Quality Index (AQI), and gas concentrations for NO, NO2, CO, etc. There are 16 variables in total.

3 datasets are planned to be used:
city_day.csv: day-level air quality data for 26 cities from 2015 to 2020. After a quick clean-up, approximately 20,000 observations can be used for analysis.
station_day.csv: day-level air quality data for 110 stations from 2015 to 2020. Approximately 70,000 observations are valid to be used.
stations.csv: the city and state information for each station.
